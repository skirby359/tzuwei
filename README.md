* 1.  OVERVIEW
************************************************************
The Zi Wei Astrology program is designed to allow you to calculate the
stars for a Zi Wei Astrology Chart.  This program does no interpretation.
What makes this program unique from most Chinese Astrology Programs is 
That the calculation of the lunar date is done by the local time and time 
Zone for calculating the lunar date.  Most other programs and base the
calculations on Beijing time.  Our experience suggests that doing the
calculations on local time produces a better chart.
Should you choose to do the calculation on Beijing time simply set the time zone to (+8).

* 4. ACKNOWLEGEMENTS
************************************************************
I need to thank Liu Ming for introducing me to Zi Wei Astrology, 
Teaching me interpretation and pointing me to sources of information on the
calculations.
I must also thank Boris Mazniker for coding.  I knew what I wanted, but 
without his help this program would not have come into being.
Master Tsai provided a critical element in making available an ephermis for the Lunar Calculations.
